            <p id="about">I am an aspiring software engineer in Dayton, OH.  I am currently attending Sinclair Community College
                for an Associates of Science in Software Development.  I am a graduate of LaunchCode's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
                I am well versed in C++ and Java with strong experience in Python and C#.
                I am always coding and working on a project(s) from a home Google Wall Calendar & Server to automating my garden/plants to
                building tube amps and radios (Ham enthusiast, I). I am also a musician writing, recording and (covid pending) performing.
                I hope to enter the software field working on mission critical systems, embedded systems, operating systems, and systems in general.
                There is no project or problem I would not enthusiastically take on.
                I am also always excited for meetups, collaboration on projects, hackathons, etc.
